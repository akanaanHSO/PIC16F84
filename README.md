# PIC16F84 Simulator
### Project for course *Rechnerarchitektur*
---
## Planned features 
### Basic Instruction Set:
   The simulator is going to implement the basic instruction set of the PIC16F84, including arithmetic, logic and data transfer.
### Programmability:
   The plan is that you can write a file ending with .LST containing Code, which the Simulator is going to read and interpret line by line.
